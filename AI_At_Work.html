                         <p>AI is used daily within the workplace. This would include Google, Siri or spam features is also AI. It is used in various ways to increase sales and productivity, automate repetitive tasks, influence decisions, and provide insight where needed. The software used in AI toolkits varies depending on the type of AI needed</p>
                            
                         <h4 class="mb-4">AI is typically used to aid in completing tasks within the workplace for tasks such as personalized advertisement, improved customer engagement; enhanced decision-making, and many more.</h4>
                         <p>AI Toolkits may still be relatively new in the workplace, however, it is evolving at an exceedingly quick pace, and many businesses creating online platforms to improve customer engagement such as Nike which provides a way to find the best size that fits you when shopping online. When also shopping online, usually on Google; you see on the websites personalized advertisements; certain items of clothing or toys, etc which you have previously searched on your browser will pop up at the sides of the website to show you options for what you may be looking for.</p>

Reactive software functions by reacting to inputs with pre-programmed responses such as recommendations on Disney Plus with suggested shows or asking Siri what the time may be.</p>

                                    <p>The software used in AI which is self-aware is different from reactive as now the aim is not for the AI to respond through pre-programmed responses but through its own choice of response. It is more complex as it requires the AI to develop its own sense of understanding and make decisions without preprogrammed responses. A truly self-aware Artificial Intelligence tool to the degree a human being is aware has not been developed yet and may never become that sophisticated. At the moment AI can learn and develop new skills to be more knowledgeable than even the smartest human beings.</p>

If they would be a good pick, along with potential strengths and weaknesses. This could be used to save resources, money, and time within the workplace whether it be fast-paced or not. Interviews could be easier and more efficient for the candidates as it saves them going to said location to do an interview, money, and help them move on if rejected. The use of AI companies and organizations are about to create online platforms, content, and websites to improve customer engagement; find the right candidate for a job role; find the right size and product for their customers, and much more. AI has begun to be implemented into many business strategies and product ideas to create the best things within the workplace. It has changed the way the workplace even operates through the implementation of AI and is only getting more advanced.</p>
